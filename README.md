# Express.js JSON Body Parsing Issue

This repository demonstrates a common issue encountered when parsing JSON request bodies in Express.js applications.  The problem arises when the request body is either empty or contains invalid JSON data, leading to unexpected behavior or errors.

## Bug Description

The provided Express.js application attempts to parse the JSON request body using `express.json()`. However, if the incoming request body is empty or contains malformed JSON, the application either fails silently or throws an error, potentially crashing the server or returning an unexpected response.

## Solution

The solution involves adding error handling to gracefully manage cases where the request body is empty or contains invalid JSON.  This ensures that the application doesn't crash and provides informative feedback to the client.
